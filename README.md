# ML-Driven-Adaptive-Sharding
This project implements a dynamic blockchain sharding system that uses machine learning clustering to intelligently partition blockchain accounts across multiple shards. The goal is to minimize cross-shard communication (which is expensive) while maintaining balanced load across shards and minimizing the cost of moving accounts between shards.
